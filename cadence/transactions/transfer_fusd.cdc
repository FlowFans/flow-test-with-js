// This transaction withdraws FUSD from the signer's account and deposits it into a recipient account. 
// This transaction will fail if the recipient does not have an FUSD receiver. 
// No funds are transferred or lost if the transaction fails.
//
// Parameters:
// - amount: The amount of FUSD to transfer (e.g. 10.0)
// - to: The recipient account address.
//
// This transaction will fail if either the sender or recipient does not have
// an FUSD vault stored in their account. To check if an account has a vault
// or initialize a new vault, use check_fusd_vault_setup.cdc and setup_fusd_vault.cdc
// respectively.
